        <h1 id="header">So far...</h1>

    <h2 id=spacing>I have my whole life planned out</h2>
    <p id=spacing> From start to end I have my entire life planned out. Step-by-step. Yes, although it sounds a bit exaggerated 
        it is not far from the truth.
    </p>

    <p id=spacing>Before I graduate, I will have a perfect school record that consists of the many extracurricular activities
         I've done over my 4 years in high school. I have <span class="excessive-text">Plans</span> on going to Stony Brook University during my freshmen-Senior
          year in college and majoring in Computer Science. Throughout college, I plan on obtaining many certifications and applying to many 
          internships that help me build creditability for the many opportunities that the CS/IT field has to offer. Last but not least when I
           graduate college with a bachelor's degree(or higher) in Computer Science I will work towards achieving my dream of becoming a software 
           developer.</p>

    <h2 id=spacing>Short/long term goals i hope to achieve</h2>
        
        
        <p id=spacing>I will learn these languages by the end of this year.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Java Script</li>
    </ol>

    <h1 id="header">My Progess</h1>

    <p id=spacing>In the past 3 years, I have obtained a few certifications related to Information technology and network security. I have attended several 
        internships related to my career readiness goals and have acquired many Professional skills/traits related to my education and social standing.
