     <h2 id=spacing>All about me</h2>

   
         <p id=spacing>My name is Wesley Ihezuo, I am 17 years old and attend The Brooklyn Steam center located at Navy Yard.
            I am a full-stack development student learning the basics of HTML, Python, and CSS. My main passions
             and interests are anything that is related to tech and as I grow older I have dreams of becoming a 
             software developer</p>

        <p id=spacing>Typically I'm like your average high school student with the everlasting hopes
             of creating a successful future for myself.</p>


        <p id=spacing>I have many hobbies which include, sports, watching anime, weight lifting, video games, 
            graphic design, etc. My favorite sports are track and basketball, currently, I am on my 
            school's track team as a sprinter and I play basketball at my local school gyms to sharpen my skills as 
            a player. I hope to become somewhat athletic as I approach my freshman year of college hence why I indulge myself in sport-like
             activities. When I'm not doing sports I watch anime. My favorite animes are Naruto, Tokyo Revengers, and Hunter x Hunter. I also love to
             participate in many extracurricular activities at school and at home. Here is a list of activities I have done in the past and 
             am currently doing as of right now.
